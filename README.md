## Flutter Diamond App Code Snippet

This is a simple Flutter app code snippet that uses the Material library. The app displays a centered image of a diamond on a screen with a custom background and an app bar.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. Import the required Material package.

2. Define the **`main`** function to run the app.

3. Configure the **`MaterialApp`** by disabling the debug banner, and set the **`home`** property to a **`Scaffold`** widget.

4. Set the **`appBar`** property of the **`Scaffold`** widget to display an app bar with a title and a custom background color.

5. Set the **`backgroundColor`** property of the **`Scaffold`** widget to a custom color.

6. Set the **`body`** property of the **`Scaffold`** widget to a **`Center`** widget that contains an **`Image`** widget with an **`AssetImage`**.

When you run this Flutter app, it will display a screen with a custom background color, an app bar with a title and a background color, and a centered image of a diamond. Make sure you have the diamond image located in the "images" folder in your project directory and specify its path in the **`pubspec.yaml`** file.
